## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing Indian traffic violations using Python for data preprocessing and visualization. The workflow began with data collection, followed by extensive cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and inconsistencies. Various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to identify patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset. Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight key insights, such as the distribution of violations across different states, time-based trends, and the impact of demographic factors. Finally, an interactive dashboard was developed using Streamlit, enabling users to explore the data dynamically. This project provides valuable insights into traffic behavior, aiding in data-driven decision-making for road safety improvements

## Data Analysis & Key Findings

### Violation Type Distribution
![Violation Type Analysis](<https://github.com/ManasBhise/Indian-Traffic-Violations-Analysis/blob/main/Distribution%20of%20Traffic%20Violations%20by%20Gender.png>)
- Over-speeding and signal jumping are the most common violations.
- Lesser violations are recorded for driving without a license.

### Gender-Based Violations
